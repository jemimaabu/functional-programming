# Getting Functional With JavaScript
A workshop on functional programming using JavaScript by [@jemimaabu](https://www.twitter.com/jemimaabu)

## What's this all about?
In this workshop, we're going to explore how the paradigm of functional programming can be applied to JavaScript (which isn't technically a functional language but it can be treated like one) to make writing code easier. 

This workshop is for you if:
- You've come across the concept of functional programming and you're interested in learning more about the practical applications
- You've worked with functional languages before (Haskell,  Elm, Erlang etc) and you'd like to explore a different aspect
- You're acquainted with the JavaScript language and you want to 
- You've never even heard of functional programming but you're a curious one anyway

## What's in it for me?

## How do I get started
There's a couple of steps to get started with this workshop:
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository
2. Open the [index.html](index.html) file in a browser

This workshop doesn't involve the use of any frameworks so it's more beginner-friendly. 

Whenever you make a change to the JavaScript file listed in the exercise, refresh the index page to view the changes.

## Making the most of it
The aim of this workshop is to get you (yes, you personally) comfortable with functional programming so if at any point, you feel that aim isn't being achieved then you can:
- Ask the instructor for hands-on help
- Utilize the resources listed below or feel free to Google any errors you run into if you don't like the idea of calling out to someone (believe me, I can relate)
- Check out the completed exercise (let this be a last last very last resort though, it feels so much more satisfactory if you figure it out on your own ;))
