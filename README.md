# Getting Functional With JavaScript
A workshop on functional programming using JavaScript by [@jemimaabu](https://www.twitter.com/jemimaabu)

## What's this all about?
In this workshop, we're going to explore how the paradigm of functional programming can be applied to JavaScript (which isn't technically a functional language but it can be treated like one) to make writing code easier. 

This workshop is for you if:
- You've come across the concept of functional programming and you're interested in learning more about the practical applications
- You've worked with functional languages before (Haskell,  Elm, Erlang etc) and you'd like to explore a different aspect
- You've never even heard of functional programming but you're a curious one anyway
