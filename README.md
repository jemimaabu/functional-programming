# Getting Functional With JavaScript
A workshop on functional programming using JavaScript by [@jemimaabu](https://www.twitter.com/jemimaabu)

## What's this all about?
In this workshop, we're going to explore how the paradigm of functional programming can be applied to JavaScript (which isn't technically a functional language but it can be treated like one) to make writing code easier. 

This workshop is for you if:
- You've come across the concept of functional programming and you're interested in learning more about the practical applications
- You've worked with functional languages before (Haskell,  Elm, Erlang etc) and you'd like to explore a different aspect
- You're acquainted with the JavaScript language and you want to apply a programming paradigm to it
- You've never even heard of functional programming but you're a curious one anyway

## What do I get out of it?
This workshop is a beginner-friendly introduction to the concept of functional programming written in JavaScript.

By the end of this workshop, you should:
- understand the concept of functional programming and the benefits of its application
- know what pure functions are and how to write them
- know what higher order functions (with relation to JavaScript) are and how to use them
- understand what currying and composition mean
- know how to avoid mutating data, changing global variables and other side effects in your code

## How do I get started?
There's a couple of steps to get started with this workshop:
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository
2. Open the [index.html](index.html) file in a browser

This workshop does not involve the use of any frameworks so it's more beginner-friendly. 

Whenever you make a change to the JavaScript file listed in the exercise, refresh the index page to view the changes.

## What if I don't get it?
The aim of this workshop is to get you (yes, you personally) comfortable with functional programming so if at any point, you feel that aim isn't being achieved or you're stuck on a particular concept, then you can:
- Ask the instructor for hands-on help
- Utilize the resources listed below or feel free to Google any errors you run into if you don't like the idea of calling out to someone (believe me, I can relate)
- Check out the completed exercise (let this be a last last very last resort though, it feels so much more satisfactory if you figure it out on your own ;))
